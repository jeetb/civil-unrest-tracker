reddit,"feeling discouraged and angry about how I was treated yesterday Yesterday was my 6th year volunteering for the Grand Floral Parade as a barrier guide or whatever they're called- we stand at the street closures, helping traffic, welcoming people, watching out for unsocial behavior,  etc. this year it returned downtown after a couple year hiatus on the East side.

The streets are closed the block before the parade for very obvious reasons: safety.  I was there to offer re-routing advice to the cars, of which there was a really simple re-route that only caused an extra few minutes of driving.

Car drivers were so incredibly mean to me. I had to tell several men to stop screaming at me or else I wouldn't help them (they were asking for directions), one guy  thanked me for ""ruining Portland"" by having the street closed to car traffic. This one incredibly trashy woman with three little kids drove the wrong way on two separate streets and after I tried to stop her, she parked her car, got out and came over and screamed in my face about how I was ""breaking the law"". Luckily a police office was right there and went and had a word with her ;)  \[by the way, it isn't like I picked the route or closed the road off, I am just a simple volunteer helping to keep little kids not get ran over by cars\]

all the pedestrians, i.e. people walking to/from the parade, were soooo nice and so many thanked me for being there. that made it worth it, so thank you if you thanked a volunteer. Even some of the homeless people that walked by were really nice, saying good morning and smiling at me as they went about their business. 

but last night, I could not sleep just thinking about all the people screaming at me. I kept thinking about the guy who is in prison because he drove through the parade 3 years ago (very close to where I was stationed)  because he was so mad about the road closures. it is a literal miracle he didn't hit and/or kill someone.

idk, I've lived here my whole 43 years, I love this city, I volunteer at events all the time, giving up much of my free weekends every year because I love this city and then to get treated like this was such a blow. I feel defeated. and I was at a spot where I didn't even get to watch the parade (which is fine,  just really love the parade, it is so cute and wholesome & some years I am at a spot where I can watch it) I kind of want to cry even writing this.",OtherwiseGanache6998,2025-06-08 17:21:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/1l6hjr2/feeling_discouraged_and_angry_about_how_i_was/,Portland,Portland,OR,45.5371,-122.65,Multnomah,0.9

I've been involved with political activism for awhile now but this was the first time he was able to attend a protest with me. I made a sign for myself and he brought the American Flag draped over his back. There were others with American flags as well. We were located in the area of downtown where the Australian reporter was shot right at the line of cops there on the street. We were yelling and chanting at the cops alongside everyone else and everything was OK until some guy came up to my partner and starting arguing with him about bringing the American flag. My partner tried to explain to him why he felt the need to bring it stating we need to reclaim our flag. We need to change the narrative, all of us are the true Americans... A mix of natives and immigrants proudly standing as the backbone to this country. This is the what this country used to stand for to the rest of the world. The other guy stated he wanted to burn the flag and my partner told him that is what they want to see, we can't do that. That's the shit MAGA wants. 

The guy left and everything went back to normal for a little bit. Then, unprovoked, the guy came back trying to wrestle the flag from my partner to light it on fire. Us three ended up in a scuffle and eventually other protesters managed to rip the guy away. Thankfully the majority of fellow protesters were kind and asked us what happened but there were a few others who still came up to him afterwards spouting the same rhetoric.

reddit,"LA protestors should call for California to confer State Citizenship to long-term residents as deportation protection Hey Reddit,

It has been incredibly scary and frustrating to see the constant news about harsh federal immigration actions – jailing long-term residents in El Salvador without trial, cancelling student visas for expressing their opinions, deporting green card holders for minor offenses, picking up hardworking workers from Home Depot. It almost feels like states that want to protect their residents are often powerless to do so.

I understand that people are unhappy about this. However, ""Fuck ICE"" isn't an effective slogan. That's not an actionable goal that our governor can help us with. And it gives additional excuses to the Trump administration to seize power.


This got me thinking about an idea: can states fight back by granting their own ""State Citizenship""? Or rather, why does the constitution prevent states from doing that? Here are my legal arguments.

The Fourteenth Amendment states, ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to its jurisdiction, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.” This defines a core group who are both U.S. and state citizens. Critically, this implies that the concept of state citizenship is distinct from US citizenship. It does not explicitly prohibit a state from extending its own state citizenship, scoped to be relevant exclusively within a single state, to individuals who do not necessarily meet the federal criteria for U.S. citizenship. It establishes a floor, not necessarily a ceiling, for state citizenship. Why must ""citizens of a state"" be exclusively a subset of ""citizens of the United States""?

# State reserved power

Conferring membership in the state's political body, particularly for individuals who lives exclusively within a single state, could be interpreted as a valid exercise of powers reserved to the states under the Tenth Amendment. States have long exercised their reserved powers to define residency for various purposes, from in-state tuition to voting in state elections. Defining membership in the state's political body for the purpose of exercising state-level rights and responsibilities is arguably within this sphere of reserved powers.

# Naturalization clause

Congress holds the power ""To establish a uniform Rule of Naturalization."" The word “naturalization” pertains specifically to the process of becoming a U.S. citizen. It does not preempt a state's ability to complement that “uniform rule” by establishing other rules that confers state citizenship to additional people. In another word, the naturalization clause grants power to the federal government without taking it away from the states.

# State citizens are US nationals

While the federal government has “plenary” power over the admission and exclusion of “aliens"", the status of a state citizen introduces an interesting distinction. If California recognizes an individual as its citizen, particularly under a law requiring an oath of allegiance to the United States, could that individual still be classified as an ""alien"" under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA)?

The INA defines a ""national of the United States"" as ""(A) a citizen of the United States, or (B) a person who, though not a citizen of the United States, owes permanent allegiance to the United States."" (8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(22)).

- A California state citizenship law could explicitly require recipients to swear or affirm permanent allegiance under oath to the United States through their allegiance to the State of California. This could qualify them as U.S. nationals under subsection (B).

- If state citizens are recognized as U.S. nationals, they are, by definition, not ""aliens"" under the INA (8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(3)). Since the INA's provisions regarding inadmissibility and deportability apply to ""aliens,"" establishing state citizenship could provide a powerful legal shield against deportation. Their state citizenship certificate could serve as prima facie evidence of their status as a US national, compelling federal authorities to recognize their right to enter and reside in their home state.

- The power to define who is a ""national"" of the United States belongs to the federal government. However, since that definition has already been established by the congress in INA, a state certifying permanent allegiance to the state, and therefore by extension to the United States, should be sufficient to establish US national status under existing statute.

Consider a future where the federal interpretation of ""subject to its jurisdiction"" in the Fourteenth Amendment is narrowed to exclude the U.S.-born children of visa holders or undocumented immigrants. A state like California could proactively enact state citizenship laws to ensure these children, born and raised in our state, are recognized as state citizens. Now that these people are under the exclusive jurisdiction of California, the federal government no longer possess the power to deport them due to lack of jurisdiction.

Yes, this is legally untested. It would absolutely be challenged and go to the Supreme Court. However, given the current political climate where long-established precedences are being challenged, we need equally bold responses from states committed to protecting their residents. If the federal government can reinterpret foundational constitutional clauses in ways that harm our communities, California should explore their own constitutional powers to provide refuge and recognition.",Apprehensive-Art3157,2025-06-09 23:48:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/comments/1l7kb90/la_protestors_should_call_for_california_to/,LosAngeles,Los Angeles,CA,34.1141,-118.4068,Los Angeles,0.7

Most importantly, don't tag your photos with overly political tags that will make the MAGA crowd suspicious of a psyop. Tag the posts with food, culture, and nature tags. Everything EXCEPT left leaning political tags.

Good luck to the protestors, and stay safe.

AN APPEAL TO CONSCIENCE

To the National Guard and United States Marines Deployed in Los Angeles

Brothers and sisters in uniform,

We write not with anger, but with reverence—for the burdens you carry, the oaths you’ve taken, and the deep moral questions before you.

You have been ordered into the streets of Los Angeles under a mission whose legality is in question and whose purpose runs contrary to the highest ideals of this Republic: that the armed forces of the United States shall never be used to threaten or suppress the people they are sworn to protect.

No lawful order compels you to violate the Constitution. No uniform silences the voice of your soul.

The people of Los Angeles are not your enemy. They are citizens. Families. Fellow Americans. Some cry out in anguish; others march in quiet resolve. Among them are clergy, veterans, children, the elderly, and immigrants whose only “crime” is to seek safety and dignity.

We call on you now—not to rebel, but to remember:

To remember your humanity.

To remember the promise of your service—to shield the weak, not be turned against them.

To remember that your highest loyalty is not to a single leader, but to the Constitution, your conscience, and the people.

If your heart is heavy—if your spirit recoils at this mission—know this:

You are not alone.

If you choose to lay down your arms and step away—if you cross the line and stand with the people—you will be welcomed not as deserters, but as heroes.

We will receive you in peace.

There will be legal protection, safe shelter, and public gratitude.

There will be room in our homes and communities for those who choose the hard path of conscience over easy compliance.

This is not a call to lawlessness. It is a call to higher law.

It is a plea to the soul of the nation, spoken through you.

When the story of this moment is told—when children ask where you stood—may the answer be clear:

“I stood with the people.”

We are waiting. Our hearts are open. We hold you in deepest hope with love.

Come home.

Roughly 500 Marines based out of the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center in California have been mobilized to respond to the protests in Los Angeles, according to three people familiar with the matter, and will join the National Guard troops that were activated by President Donald Trump over the weekend without the consent of California’s governor or the city’s mayor.

“Graduation season is sacred. It is a time of celebration, not intimidation,” said LAUSD Board Vice President Rocío Rivas. “It’s a time for honoring student achievement, not inflicting fear. Sending ICE into our communities at this moment is a deliberate act.”

Superintendent Alberto Carvalho and the Board of Education convened the news conference at the district’s headquarters in downtown L.A. to condemn the immigration enforcement actions, ask the federal government to recall the National Guard and outline steps to protect students, families and employees as the school year ends.

reddit,"Classic blue Dodger caps could be a way to make protesters extremely hard to affirmatively identify. We all know the so-called administration is going to do everything in its power to capture and prosecute those protesting ICE and the military's invasion of our city. What if most of these protesters are wearing the same hat? They help to obscure faces which is the easiest way to identify people both in the moment and through photos after the face. People at immediate risk of being detained could slip back into a sea of Dodger blue hats and the cops will lose them.  

They are such a central part of LA street style so protesters could easily duck away from the protests and pose as passersby. If we start doing this, it's not like they can arrest everyone in LA who dares to walk around in a Dodger hat. Not to give them any ideas, but they'd have to turn Dodger Stadium into a makeshift jail to do that. 

Much of our city already owns a Dodger hat and they are easily accessible to those who don't. This is just a potential strategy to make things a bit harder on the fascists invading our city and, ideally, waste a lot of their time trying to discern specific Dodger hat wearers from crowds of Dodger hat wearers.

reddit,"cousin killed by police and i’m looking for resources hi, i’m sorry if this is not appropriate but i’ve been looking all over and haven’t been able to find anything. my cousin that was like a brother to me was killed by police in a mental health center while having a schizophrenic episode. he is not black however i absolutely do believe this is a case of unnecessary use of deadly force. i’m having a very hard time coping, i feel like the police are lying about what happened because it doesn’t add up and they’re releasing as little information as possible about the incident while releasing information about my cousin’s mental health and “crimes”. i would really appreciate it if anyone could point me towards resources or groups with people who have been through something similar. thank you. 

edit: i am not looking for legal resources since im leaving that up to my uncle, im more so looking for emotional support",MedusaRondanini,2024-11-07 17:19:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackLivesMatter/comments/1glvoyn/cousin_killed_by_police_and_im_looking_for/,BlackLivesMatter,,,,,,0.3
