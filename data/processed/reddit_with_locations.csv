The language we use does actually matter. A riot is disorganized and is perceived as inherently violent and easier to justify military suppression. A “resistance” or “uprising” connotes organized and purposeful action that isn’t inherently violent, but a justified response to violence.

It’s way too easy to dismiss legitimate resistances if they’re interpreted as mindless and violent “riots.” Choose your words carefully. How we tell the story of what’s happening will matter.

reddit,"“Tasted a little tear gas— tasted like fascism” Sir on KCAL News tonight who said these words, thank you. Theres a lot of indifferent old people in LA watching the news (my parents included) who really think that The Donald is just targeting ""violent criminals"" and ""people taking jobs from Americans"" (neither is true). The past week alone have had so many lives completely upended for normal community members of Los Angeles. People that don't bother anybody and will yeild at a yellow light so you can make that unprotected left. Children who didn't even know they were here outside of the law abducted and pulled apart from their parents. Sure if you round up 200 people from a facotry, im sure youll find a tax evader, a thief, a even a former gang banger but my guy, you can find those same people at any church in LA too regardless of citizenship (possibly without even stepping off the pulpit). Today alone we saw a Black Hawk touch down and unload tons of ""less lethal"" amo and weapons in the middle of a street while the president of the united states authorized 2,000 guardsmen to deal with some rock throwers so ICE can keep kidnapping innocent people who made 1 wrong choice of going to work that day. Like what are we even doing here?

Its like they're begging for a Kent State Massacre or a Jackson State massacre or a University of New Mexico massacre or Orangeburg Massacre or insert whatever other massacre you want where people were killed for defending the rights of their fellow community members. This isnt some boogaloo movement where knuckleheads want to just cause trouble and be on tv. Our very community is under attack so some guy in a suit can look like he's defending some fake replacement to gain voter apathy towards an ever widening definition of ""we're only going after criminals"" 

Its imperative imo to not wait for them to ""come to your neighborhood"" before you do something to stand up for LA. There's millions of us and we can't just let them take our family members away.  Keep that same energy you have when a cvs closes bc of a shoplifting ring when a factory, office, clothing mill, farm, school, medical center, grocery store, hotel, dance hall, community hospital, church, or restaurant shuts down bc ICE stole the community members who ran them

As a Marine myself, I swore an oath to defend the people of this country from all enemies, foreign and domestic.Tragically, in this case, the threat appears to be fostered by our own government by limiting the right to assemble, the right to privacy, and the freedom of speech. They have detained U.S. citizens of color through racial profiling and apprehended immigrants off the streets without due process.
No political party should ever mobilize active-duty military forces against American citizens simply over a difference in political beliefs.

Turning the American military against its own people on this scale is a horrifying act. Most citizens have little to no knowledge of how to counter military maneuvers while trying to peacefully protest.

I fully support the patriots in L.A. and the surrounding cities who are protesting for their freedom and their right to live. As an enlisted Marine, I once swore to protect those rights and I still hold to that oath. I've been closely observing the public's reaction to the militarized police and federal agents tearing communities apart. But if the Marines are deployed, it's fucking go time.

reddit,"The National Guard is coming to LA. Here's what we know, how to prepare, and why it's important. As I’m writing this, the NYT has reported that 2,000 National Guard troops will be converging on LA within the next 24 hours (1). I expect protests to take place **t o m o r r o w at City Hall**. In any case, it seems like the administration is looking for some sort of showdown. 

Knowing the current administration, they want a spectacle. They will use any perceived act of violence against them as a justification to crack down with even greater force. And not just on the protestors, on the immigrants themselves. That’s why **it’s critical that we remain nonviolent and show up en masse so we can debunk their false narrative of who we are**.

The legal landscape of both immigration and the president’s authority to send in the National Guard is rapidly changing. So too is our understanding of the rights of protestors and whether those rights will be respected. Basically, we don’t know what’s going to happen. The best thing we can do is to stay informed and be prepared to react quickly. The ACLU has a helpful guide on your rights as a protestor (2). You have the right to protest, the right to remain silent, and the right to due process. Don’t let the administration forget that.

LA has stood strong through a lot of things. We’ll stand strong through this, too. This hurts for a lot of reasons, and I think one of the reasons this hurts for me is because immigrants are the whole point of all of this crazy experiment that we call America. When the federal government targets the people working hard for a better life, it’s a betrayal of the foundational promise of our country’s existence.

The people targeted for deportation in the recent ICE raids are regular people. They’re the gardeners, construction workers, and landscapers who work tirelessly to make our city beautiful. They’re our friends and family. There are nearly a million undocumented Angelenos, most of whom have been in the United States for more than ten years (3). Many of them will be forced to start anew in a country they don’t know if they are deported. The United States is their country, because the spirit of this country is the spirit of hope – *esperanza*.

**If you’re protesting:**

I highly recommend checking out this list by the Activist Checklist to prepare in advance, especially if this is your first situation like this (4). Wired also has a great resource guide, including a handy supply list (5). But here are some general pointers – feel free to add anything in the comments:

* Understand that any confrontations will be tense. A lot of people – including members of the National guard – will be under a lot of emotional stress and pressure as they react to an uncertain situation. **It will be hard to make good decisions**.  
* Turn off Face ID on your devices for all purposes.  
* Disable message previews on your home screen. Enable passcode for any messaging or call functionality.  
* Consider leaving your phone at home, or keeping it powered off.
   * If you are at risk of being arrested, **power your phone off**.  
* Don’t drive. Walk, bike, or take transit. Pay the fare with cash and wear a hat and mask if that’s your thing.  
* Prepare by knowing the area. Since the protest will likely be at City Hall, **study a map of DTLA**. Know where Metro runs, which buses you can get on, and which streets to take if you need to get away from a situation.  
* **Assume you are being surveilled** and anything you do will be used against you in court.   
* Wear shoes you’re comfortable running in.  
* Keep emergency contact information with you at all times.

reddit,"Perspective on today's events from a humble Wisconsinite I am not from Los Angeles, nor have I ever been to California at all. I was born and raised in the tundra that is northern Wisconsin.

Growing up and living as an adult in a very purple state has largely left me desensitized toward politics, and its direct effects on regular people. It's far easier to avoid politics altogether than to deal with the vastly differing, and often extreme, personal beliefs and views of my fellow Wisconsinites.

However today I was confronted by the news and social media showing me what was happening today in your city. It took me way off guard, and made me fully appreciate the gravity of the political climate we as Americans are living in right now.

What I saw was we, the people, standing against an overwhelming and oppressive authority attempting to trample the constitution our forefathers fought, bled, and died to uphold. What I saw was the epitome of American. Resistance, against all odds, to tyranny.

To those protesting or considering protesting, what you are doing is working. You are forcing not only the nation, but the world to truly see how fed up we are of all the lies, the hate, and the bigotry displayed by our current presidential administration. People like me are starting to see just how important the voice of the people is. And just how loud it can be.

So to you all: don't give up the ship. Do not relent. Please, for the sake of our nation, never stop fighting. I pray that today was only the beginning, and I pray that your fighting spirit will spread like wildfire.

America is bleeding, and she will not be healed until we root out fascism in our communities and our government. Permanently. You are all an inspiration to Americans everywhere, regardless of whatever slop state-sponsored media would have you believe. My fellow Wisconsinites and I are with you, and we will be out in force in Madison, Green Bay, Milwaukee, and many more on June 14.

It seems to me that Trump and ICE are deliberately trying to provoke us. While the threat of ICE taking people away and separating families is real, they are making a big show of things and deploying way more forces than would be necessary to carry out these small raids. 

My opinion is that we should work together to hide away any undocumented individuals and families. It's the weekend so let's just chill and stay in. Let them march through deserted streets with their camo and guns. 

If they do come to your house, don't let them in without a warrant. Only allow citizens to answer the door and have your ID with you. 

If they can't make headlines, if they can't make Los Angeles look lawless on Fox News, they'll go away empty-handed. These poor undocumented immigrants are just pawns, an excuse to attack our city so Trump can look strong and perhaps eventually declare martial law.

reddit,"Evil Bigot Defeated at Pride in the Park Here we see notorious bigot and street preacher Matthew Meinecke laying on the ground in the parking lot after a group of angry attendees non-violently blocked him and his hateful sign from re-entering the Pride in the Park event in Seattle. As a human wall formed to impede his path, he responded by trying to push through the wall while shrieking, “Stop hurting me! My leg! My leg!”—despite the fact that no one had laid a finger on him.

Every attempt he made to push forward into the event was met with firm, non-violent resistance. At one point, he pressed his full body weight against a woman half his size, who resolutely held her ground. It’s hard not to assume he singled her out as an easy target, believing she was the weakest link in the group. Security personnel were present and helped keep the situation as peaceful as possible. Ironically, the only instance of physical aggression came from Matthew himself—against the woman he pushed. She eventually walked away after he sat down mid-tantrum and began crying like the six-foot-five man-baby he is.

Not long after, he sat down on top of his hate-sign, and called the Seattle Police Department in a desperate attempt to have them play “Captain Save-a-Hoe,” begging for an escort into the park. Despite nearly an hour of melodramatic sobbing and posturing, SPD did not intervene. At one point, he laid face down, rear in the air, on top of his own sign—an oddly fitting pose for the occasion—and continued his tantrum. In a display of compassion he didn’t deserve, members of the very crowd he antagonized offered him water, assistance, and even a free trans pride flag, visible in my attached photos.

Eventually, I left him to his theatrics and returned to the festivities inside, where the mood was joyfully free of hate. Upon my exit later, SPD had finally arrived but still declined to assist him. The crowd remained firm, peacefully blocking his re-entry. He tried again to force his way through, only to walk into a tree and trip over a curb, all while screaming that he was being assaulted—claims the officers clearly didn’t believe, as no arrests were made.

The link above shows ICE agents kidnapping people from the Seattle courthouse. A more conservative mod took down my previous post but, i think those on this subreddit are concerned about the federal overreach and authoritarianism that's taking place right now. 

Yesterday, in L.A. ICE rolled up to a warehouse and kidnapped workers. The community rose up and confronted them. In San Diego a neighborhood drove ICE out. In Kent, ICE raided a business. ICE isnt going after ""criminal activity"" they're going after people at work and harmless people just trying to live. An SEIU Union president was arrested yesterday in California!

We have to stand up for our neighbors and community. ICE has offices in Seattle and protest is a Seattle tradition. 

So Mods, your move. Do you wanna shut up dialogue?",PubliusCC25,2025-06-07 21:37:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/1l5vwka/after_ice_is_done_targeting_criminals_how_long_do/,Seattle,Seattle,WA,47.6211,-122.3244,King,0.9
