reddit,"feeling discouraged and angry about how I was treated yesterday Yesterday was my 6th year volunteering for the Grand Floral Parade as a barrier guide or whatever they're called- we stand at the street closures, helping traffic, welcoming people, watching out for unsocial behavior,  etc. this year it returned downtown after a couple year hiatus on the East side.

The streets are closed the block before the parade for very obvious reasons: safety.  I was there to offer re-routing advice to the cars, of which there was a really simple re-route that only caused an extra few minutes of driving.

Car drivers were so incredibly mean to me. I had to tell several men to stop screaming at me or else I wouldn't help them (they were asking for directions), one guy  thanked me for ""ruining Portland"" by having the street closed to car traffic. This one incredibly trashy woman with three little kids drove the wrong way on two separate streets and after I tried to stop her, she parked her car, got out and came over and screamed in my face about how I was ""breaking the law"". Luckily a police office was right there and went and had a word with her ;)  \[by the way, it isn't like I picked the route or closed the road off, I am just a simple volunteer helping to keep little kids not get ran over by cars\]

all the pedestrians, i.e. people walking to/from the parade, were soooo nice and so many thanked me for being there. that made it worth it, so thank you if you thanked a volunteer. Even some of the homeless people that walked by were really nice, saying good morning and smiling at me as they went about their business. 

but last night, I could not sleep just thinking about all the people screaming at me. I kept thinking about the guy who is in prison because he drove through the parade 3 years ago (very close to where I was stationed)  because he was so mad about the road closures. it is a literal miracle he didn't hit and/or kill someone.

idk, I've lived here my whole 43 years, I love this city, I volunteer at events all the time, giving up much of my free weekends every year because I love this city and then to get treated like this was such a blow. I feel defeated. and I was at a spot where I didn't even get to watch the parade (which is fine,  just really love the parade, it is so cute and wholesome & some years I am at a spot where I can watch it) I kind of want to cry even writing this.",OtherwiseGanache6998,2025-06-08 17:21:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/1l6hjr2/feeling_discouraged_and_angry_about_how_i_was/,Portland,Portland,OR,45.5371,-122.65,Multnomah,0.9

Is it even worth my time? Even if I provided clear video evidence of something like this to the police, would it result in anything happening?

Edit: wow I’m surprised by the degree of indifference to this sort of thing. Let’s be clear, I’m by NO means a stickler for adhering to authority, law, etc….having said that, I’ve watched 5 people run reds in the last like 30 days and it’s straight up sketch as fuck. To me there’s a serious distinction with this sort of thing when it poses a huge and legit danger to society. Everyone should care about this type of bullshit and stand up against it. 

So to be clear, I was joking when I said I was being petty. I don’t think this is petty at all and I think it’s totally justified and imperative to society to take the time (out of an actually crazy busy day) to try and do something about this.

reddit,"Amid LA Protests, Conspiracy Theories and Fake Images Spread Online (Gift Article) From the article:

""Darren L. Linvill, a researcher at Clemson University’s Media Forensics Hub, said conservatives online were “building up the riots in a performative way” to help bolster Mr. Trump’s claims that Los Angeles had been taken over by “violent, insurrectionist mobs.”

Dr. Linvill said the posts were also “a bit self-fulfilling.” “As they direct attention to it,” he said, “more protesters will show up.”""

And...

""“It is nationwide conspiracy of liberals against not only Trump but against American people in general,” Aleksandr Dugin, a prominent nationalist in Russia, wrote on X on Sunday.

Disinformation in situations like these spreads so quickly and widely that efforts to verify facts cannot keep up, said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel at Free Press, an advocacy organization that studies the intersection of media, technology and the law. She described it as part of “a much longer effort to delegitimize peaceful resistance movements.”

“Information warfare is always a symptom of conflict, stoked often by those in power to fuel their own illiberal goals,” she said. “It confuses audiences, scares people who might otherwise have empathy for the cause and divides us when we need solidarity most.”""

I've been involved with political activism for awhile now but this was the first time he was able to attend a protest with me. I made a sign for myself and he brought the American Flag draped over his back. There were others with American flags as well. We were located in the area of downtown where the Australian reporter was shot right at the line of cops there on the street. We were yelling and chanting at the cops alongside everyone else and everything was OK until some guy came up to my partner and starting arguing with him about bringing the American flag. My partner tried to explain to him why he felt the need to bring it stating we need to reclaim our flag. We need to change the narrative, all of us are the true Americans... A mix of natives and immigrants proudly standing as the backbone to this country. This is the what this country used to stand for to the rest of the world. The other guy stated he wanted to burn the flag and my partner told him that is what they want to see, we can't do that. That's the shit MAGA wants. 

The guy left and everything went back to normal for a little bit. Then, unprovoked, the guy came back trying to wrestle the flag from my partner to light it on fire. Us three ended up in a scuffle and eventually other protesters managed to rip the guy away. Thankfully the majority of fellow protesters were kind and asked us what happened but there were a few others who still came up to him afterwards spouting the same rhetoric. Chastising my partner and wanting to take the flag away to burn it. 

Burning the flag will ***NOT*** help our cause. Attacking fellow protesters when we have a common enemy right in front of us will ***NOT*** help anyone.

reddit,"LA protestors should call for California to confer State Citizenship to long-term residents as deportation protection Hey Reddit,

It has been incredibly scary and frustrating to see the constant news about harsh federal immigration actions – jailing long-term residents in El Salvador without trial, cancelling student visas for expressing their opinions, deporting green card holders for minor offenses, picking up hardworking workers from Home Depot. It almost feels like states that want to protect their residents are often powerless to do so.

I understand that people are unhappy about this. However, ""Fuck ICE"" isn't an effective slogan. That's not an actionable goal that our governor can help us with. And it gives additional excuses to the Trump administration to seize power.


This got me thinking about an idea: can states fight back by granting their own ""State Citizenship""? Or rather, why does the constitution prevent states from doing that? Here are my legal arguments.

The Fourteenth Amendment states, ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to its jurisdiction, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.” This defines a core group who are both U.S. and state citizens. Critically, this implies that the concept of state citizenship is distinct from US citizenship. It does not explicitly prohibit a state from extending its own state citizenship, scoped to be relevant exclusively within a single state, to individuals who do not necessarily meet the federal criteria for U.S. citizenship. It establishes a floor, not necessarily a ceiling, for state citizenship. Why must ""citizens of a state"" be exclusively a subset of ""citizens of the United States""?

# State reserved power

Conferring membership in the state's political body, particularly for individuals who lives exclusively within a single state, could be interpreted as a valid exercise of powers reserved to the states under the Tenth Amendment. States have long exercised their reserved powers to define residency for various purposes, from in-state tuition to voting in state elections. Defining membership in the state's political body for the purpose of exercising state-level rights and responsibilities is arguably within this sphere of reserved powers.

# Naturalization clause

Congress holds the power ""To establish a uniform Rule of Naturalization."" The word “naturalization” pertains specifically to the process of becoming a U.S. citizen. It does not preempt a state's ability to complement that “uniform rule” by establishing other rules that confers state citizenship to additional people. In another word, the naturalization clause grants power to the federal government without taking it away from the states.

# State citizens are US nationals

While the federal government has “plenary” power over the admission and exclusion of “aliens"", the status of a state citizen introduces an interesting distinction. If California recognizes an individual as its citizen, particularly under a law requiring an oath of allegiance to the United States, could that individual still be classified as an ""alien"" under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA)?

The INA defines a ""national of the United States"" as ""(A) a citizen of the United States, or (B) a person who, though not a citizen of the United States, owes permanent allegiance to the United States."" (8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(22)).

- A California state citizenship law could explicitly require recipients to swear or affirm permanent allegiance under oath to the United States through their allegiance to the State of California. This could qualify them as U.S. nationals under subsection (B).

- If state citizens are recognized as U.S. nationals, they are, by definition, not ""aliens"" under the INA (8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(3)). Since the INA's provisions regarding inadmissibility and deportability apply to ""aliens,"" establishing state citizenship could provide a powerful legal shield against deportation. Their state citizenship certificate could serve as prima facie evidence of their status as a US national, compelling federal authorities to recognize their right to enter and reside in their home state.

- The power to define who is a ""national"" of the United States belongs to the federal government. However, since that definition has already been established by the congress in INA, a state certifying permanent allegiance to the state, and therefore by extension to the United States, should be sufficient to establish US national status under existing statute.

Consider a future where the federal interpretation of ""subject to its jurisdiction"" in the Fourteenth Amendment is narrowed to exclude the U.S.-born children of visa holders or undocumented immigrants. A state like California could proactively enact state citizenship laws to ensure these children, born and raised in our state, are recognized as state citizens. Now that these people are under the exclusive jurisdiction of California, the federal government no longer possess the power to deport them due to lack of jurisdiction.

Yes, this is legally untested. It would absolutely be challenged and go to the Supreme Court. However, given the current political climate where long-established precedences are being challenged, we need equally bold responses from states committed to protecting their residents. If the federal government can reinterpret foundational constitutional clauses in ways that harm our communities, California should explore their own constitutional powers to provide refuge and recognition.",Apprehensive-Art3157,2025-06-09 23:48:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/comments/1l7kb90/la_protestors_should_call_for_california_to/,LosAngeles,Los Angeles,CA,34.1141,-118.4068,Los Angeles,0.7

AN APPEAL TO CONSCIENCE

To the National Guard and United States Marines Deployed in Los Angeles

Brothers and sisters in uniform,

We write not with anger, but with reverence—for the burdens you carry, the oaths you’ve taken, and the deep moral questions before you.

You have been ordered into the streets of Los Angeles under a mission whose legality is in question and whose purpose runs contrary to the highest ideals of this Republic: that the armed forces of the United States shall never be used to threaten or suppress the people they are sworn to protect.

No lawful order compels you to violate the Constitution. No uniform silences the voice of your soul.

The people of Los Angeles are not your enemy. They are citizens. Families. Fellow Americans. Some cry out in anguish; others march in quiet resolve. Among them are clergy, veterans, children, the elderly, and immigrants whose only “crime” is to seek safety and dignity.

We call on you now—not to rebel, but to remember:

To remember your humanity.

To remember the promise of your service—to shield the weak, not be turned against them.

To remember that your highest loyalty is not to a single leader, but to the Constitution, your conscience, and the people.

If your heart is heavy—if your spirit recoils at this mission—know this:

You are not alone.

If you choose to lay down your arms and step away—if you cross the line and stand with the people—you will be welcomed not as deserters, but as heroes.

We will receive you in peace.

There will be legal protection, safe shelter, and public gratitude.

There will be room in our homes and communities for those who choose the hard path of conscience over easy compliance.

This is not a call to lawlessness. It is a call to higher law.

It is a plea to the soul of the nation, spoken through you.

When the story of this moment is told—when children ask where you stood—may the answer be clear:

“I stood with the people.”

We are waiting. Our hearts are open. We hold you in deepest hope with love.

Come home.

My partner and her wife depend on me: I take care of the home and the disabled partner and the animals so one can work full time. When I am arrested in a protest I am afraid SPD will paralyze me forever by twisting my spine or forcing me into a position, and then throw me in jail with men for trying to protect my rights or the rights of others. I'm absolutely pants shitting terrified to go out to protest because of this.

That and I'm autistic and can't read these situations the best. Seemed like everyone else knew before me that OWS was getting violent and then suddenly I am in the middle of a bunch of violence holding a basket of flowers and ducking for cover.

I guess this is a long fucking way of asking, as a cowardly fool who's almost lost her ability to walk, how can I help? What can I do that isn't throwing my body in front of armed men who really want to use me as an example?",Any-Ask-5535,2025-06-10 18:08:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/1l85tm2/how_can_i_help/,Seattle,Des Moines,IA,41.5725,-93.6105,Polk,0.9

reddit,"Witnessed hit-and-run near Twilight Exit tonight Earlier this evening (June 9) around 9:40 PM, a group of women were involved in a loud altercation near Twilight Exit in the Central District. The situation escalated and eventually moved toward a white sedan parked nearby on East Cherry Street. The vehicle appeared to be an early-to-mid 2000s model—possibly a Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla, or Hyundai Elantra.

After some time, one of the women got into the white car, drove erratically on East Cherry Street next to Twilight Exit, and then sped down the alley directly next to the bar, where she struck a man.

She left the scene immediately.

This has already been formally reported to the police, but I’m hoping someone in the area may have security footage facing East Cherry or may have also witnessed something that could help identify the car or the person driving.

I'm one of millions of people that would like to take the streets with my family and American flags to protest what this administration is doing to our hard working neighbors. I truly believe a show of force like this is how we'll stop Trump in his tracks.

Burning cars and throwing rocks sounds like fun for 20 year old me, but 40 year old me with a family knows that it won't get us anywhere and plays right into Trump's hands.

I know this probably isn't the right sub to ask, but I'm certain there's countless people out there that feel the same way. Thoughts?

I’ve heard a handful of local community members voice fear that the police may not be there to keep us safe this year but to enable shenanigans from counter protestors just like they did in Cal Anderson park a few weeks ago. 

I personally just want safe passage to walk in the parade, jump in the fountain, and eat a corn dog under the space needle. Can we please just do the pride thing right this year?
