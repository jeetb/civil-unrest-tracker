reddit,"feeling discouraged and angry about how I was treated yesterday Yesterday was my 6th year volunteering for the Grand Floral Parade as a barrier guide or whatever they're called- we stand at the street closures, helping traffic, welcoming people, watching out for unsocial behavior,  etc. this year it returned downtown after a couple year hiatus on the East side.

The streets are closed the block before the parade for very obvious reasons: safety.  I was there to offer re-routing advice to the cars, of which there was a really simple re-route that only caused an extra few minutes of driving.

Car drivers were so incredibly mean to me. I had to tell several men to stop screaming at me or else I wouldn't help them (they were asking for directions), one guy  thanked me for ""ruining Portland"" by having the street closed to car traffic. This one incredibly trashy woman with three little kids drove the wrong way on two separate streets and after I tried to stop her, she parked her car, got out and came over and screamed in my face about how I was ""breaking the law"". Luckily a police office was right there and went and had a word with her ;)  \[by the way, it isn't like I picked the route or closed the road off, I am just a simple volunteer helping to keep little kids not get ran over by cars\]

all the pedestrians, i.e. people walking to/from the parade, were soooo nice and so many thanked me for being there. that made it worth it, so thank you if you thanked a volunteer. Even some of the homeless people that walked by were really nice, saying good morning and smiling at me as they went about their business. 

but last night, I could not sleep just thinking about all the people screaming at me. I kept thinking about the guy who is in prison because he drove through the parade 3 years ago (very close to where I was stationed)  because he was so mad about the road closures. it is a literal miracle he didn't hit and/or kill someone.

idk, I've lived here my whole 43 years, I love this city, I volunteer at events all the time, giving up much of my free weekends every year because I love this city and then to get treated like this was such a blow. I feel defeated. and I was at a spot where I didn't even get to watch the parade (which is fine,  just really love the parade, it is so cute and wholesome & some years I am at a spot where I can watch it) I kind of want to cry even writing this.",OtherwiseGanache6998,2025-06-08 17:21:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/1l6hjr2/feeling_discouraged_and_angry_about_how_i_was/,Portland

Is it even worth my time? Even if I provided clear video evidence of something like this to the police, would it result in anything happening?

Edit: wow I’m surprised by the degree of indifference to this sort of thing. Let’s be clear, I’m by NO means a stickler for adhering to authority, law, etc….having said that, I’ve watched 5 people run reds in the last like 30 days and it’s straight up sketch as fuck. To me there’s a serious distinction with this sort of thing when it poses a huge and legit danger to society. Everyone should care about this type of bullshit and stand up against it. 

So to be clear, I was joking when I said I was being petty. I don’t think this is petty at all and I think it’s totally justified and imperative to society to take the time (out of an actually crazy busy day) to try and do something about this.

reddit,"Amid LA Protests, Conspiracy Theories and Fake Images Spread Online (Gift Article) From the article:

""Darren L. Linvill, a researcher at Clemson University’s Media Forensics Hub, said conservatives online were “building up the riots in a performative way” to help bolster Mr. Trump’s claims that Los Angeles had been taken over by “violent, insurrectionist mobs.”

Dr. Linvill said the posts were also “a bit self-fulfilling.” “As they direct attention to it,” he said, “more protesters will show up.”""

And...

""“It is nationwide conspiracy of liberals against not only Trump but against American people in general,” Aleksandr Dugin, a prominent nationalist in Russia, wrote on X on Sunday.

Disinformation in situations like these spreads so quickly and widely that efforts to verify facts cannot keep up, said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel at Free Press, an advocacy organization that studies the intersection of media, technology and the law. She described it as part of “a much longer effort to delegitimize peaceful resistance movements.”

“Information warfare is always a symptom of conflict, stoked often by those in power to fuel their own illiberal goals,” she said. “It confuses audiences, scares people who might otherwise have empathy for the cause and divides us when we need solidarity most.”""

I can't stand what's happening to my country and my city. I couldn't stand it in 2011 so I camped in a park in New York with a bunch of punks and had a blast until the riot police showed up.

Okay you see the thing is, it's 15 years later and nowadays I have a very bad back and im one slip or fall away from permanent paralysis. My partner and her wife depend on me: I take care of the home and the disabled partner and the animals so one can work full time. When I am arrested in a protest I am afraid SPD will paralyze me forever by twisting my spine or forcing me into a position, and then throw me in jail with men for trying to protect my rights or the rights of others. I'm absolutely pants shitting terrified to go out to protest because of this.

That and I'm autistic and can't read these situations the best. Seemed like everyone else knew before me that OWS was getting violent and then suddenly I am in the middle of a bunch of violence holding a basket of flowers and ducking for cover.

The vehicle appeared to be an early-to-mid 2000s model—possibly a Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla, or Hyundai Elantra.

After some time, one of the women got into the white car, drove erratically on East Cherry Street next to Twilight Exit, and then sped down the alley directly next to the bar, where she struck a man.

She left the scene immediately.

This has already been formally reported to the police, but I’m hoping someone in the area may have security footage facing East Cherry or may have also witnessed something that could help identify the car or the person driving.
