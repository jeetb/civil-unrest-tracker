reddit,"feeling discouraged and angry about how I was treated yesterday Yesterday was my 6th year volunteering for the Grand Floral Parade as a barrier guide or whatever they're called- we stand at the street closures, helping traffic, welcoming people, watching out for unsocial behavior,  etc. this year it returned downtown after a couple year hiatus on the East side.

The streets are closed the block before the parade for very obvious reasons: safety.  I was there to offer re-routing advice to the cars, of which there was a really simple re-route that only caused an extra few minutes of driving.

Car drivers were so incredibly mean to me. I had to tell several men to stop screaming at me or else I wouldn't help them (they were asking for directions), one guy  thanked me for ""ruining Portland"" by having the street closed to car traffic. This one incredibly trashy woman with three little kids drove the wrong way on two separate streets and after I tried to stop her, she parked her car, got out and came over and screamed in my face about how I was ""breaking the law"". Luckily a police office was right there and went and had a word with her ;)  \[by the way, it isn't like I picked the route or closed the road off, I am just a simple volunteer helping to keep little kids not get ran over by cars\]

all the pedestrians, i.e. people walking to/from the parade, were soooo nice and so many thanked me for being there. that made it worth it, so thank you if you thanked a volunteer. Even some of the homeless people that walked by were really nice, saying good morning and smiling at me as they went about their business. 

but last night, I could not sleep just thinking about all the people screaming at me. I kept thinking about the guy who is in prison because he drove through the parade 3 years ago (very close to where I was stationed)  because he was so mad about the road closures. it is a literal miracle he didn't hit and/or kill someone.

idk, I've lived here my whole 43 years, I love this city, I volunteer at events all the time, giving up much of my free weekends every year because I love this city and then to get treated like this was such a blow. I feel defeated. and I was at a spot where I didn't even get to watch the parade (which is fine,  just really love the parade, it is so cute and wholesome & some years I am at a spot where I can watch it) I kind of want to cry even writing this.",OtherwiseGanache6998,2025-06-08 17:21:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/1l6hjr2/feeling_discouraged_and_angry_about_how_i_was/,Portland

reddit,"Classic blue Dodger caps could be a way to make protesters extremely hard to affirmatively identify. We all know the so-called administration is going to do everything in its power to capture and prosecute those protesting ICE and the military's invasion of our city. What if most of these protesters are wearing the same hat? They help to obscure faces which is the easiest way to identify people both in the moment and through photos after the face. People at immediate risk of being detained could slip back into a sea of Dodger blue hats and the cops will lose them.  

They are such a central part of LA street style so protesters could easily duck away from the protests and pose as passersby. If we start doing this, it's not like they can arrest everyone in LA who dares to walk around in a Dodger hat. Not to give them any ideas, but they'd have to turn Dodger Stadium into a makeshift jail to do that. 

Much of our city already owns a Dodger hat and they are easily accessible to those who don't. This is just a potential strategy to make things a bit harder on the fascists invading our city and, ideally, waste a lot of their time trying to discern specific Dodger hat wearers from crowds of Dodger hat wearers.

I assumed some would post in support (I don’t have much social media tho). As they housed so far away they aren’t affected by the protests & the destruction? 

Secondly, I have seen the issues between Elon & Trump. Is this in any way connected or is this a completely separate issue that Trump has managed to involve himself in? 

I apologise if what I’ve asked seems insensitive. It’s not intentional. I just have seen so many images and read some posts on this group and I’m just baffled that this isn’t a topic i can discuss with my friends - who seem largely unaware or uninterested.

reddit,"Should I Keep My Windows Closed After Tear Gas Deployment Nearby? If police deployed a large amount of tear gas (thousands of canisters) within 10 blocks of your location, even if it has been around 12 hours, you should still take precautions. Tear gas particles can linger much longer than many people realize.

How long does tear gas remain in the air?

Typically, tear gas disperses from the air within minutes to hours, depending on:
	•	Weather conditions (humidity, rain, wind)
	•	Amount deployed (large deployments can leave residues for significantly longer)
	•	Surrounding environment (urban structures can trap gas particles)

In cases of heavy deployment (like thousands of canisters), residual contamination can last from several hours to even days, especially in areas that have not been cleaned or ventilated properly.

Recommended Safety Steps:
	•	Keep windows and doors closed: Prevent lingering particles from entering your home.
	•	Seal gaps and cracks: Use towels or tape if you notice irritation or odor.
	•	Run air purifiers: Use ones with HEPA filters and activated carbon if available.
	•	Avoid outdoor exposure: Limit your time outside until you’re sure the air has cleared.
	•	Clean exposed surfaces: If your windows were open earlier, clean surfaces with soap and water or mild detergent while wearing gloves.
	•	Protect pets: Animals and especially birds can be sensitive to irritants, in some cases deadly, so keep them indoors and monitor their health.

Health Risks:

Even minor exposure can cause:
	•	Eye irritation (redness, tearing)
	•	Respiratory discomfort (coughing, shortness of breath)
	•	Skin irritation (burning sensation)

If you experience any severe or prolonged symptoms, seek medical attention promptly.

Check Local Air Quality:

Monitor local air quality reports or community updates to know when it’s safe to reopen windows and resume normal activities.

Stay safe!",nicepresident,2025-06-09 12:50:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/comments/1l73yil/should_i_keep_my_windows_closed_after_tear_gas/,LosAngeles

reddit,"Evil Bigot Defeated at Pride in the Park Here we see notorious bigot and street preacher Matthew Meinecke laying on the ground in the parking lot after a group of angry attendees non-violently blocked him and his hateful sign from re-entering the Pride in the Park event in Seattle. As a human wall formed to impede his path, he responded by trying to push through the wall while shrieking, “Stop hurting me! My leg! My leg!”—despite the fact that no one had laid a finger on him.

Every attempt he made to push forward into the event was met with firm, non-violent resistance. At one point, he pressed his full body weight against a woman half his size, who resolutely held her ground. It’s hard not to assume he singled her out as an easy target, believing she was the weakest link in the group. Security personnel were present and helped keep the situation as peaceful as possible. Ironically, the only instance of physical aggression came from Matthew himself—against the woman he pushed. She eventually walked away after he sat down mid-tantrum and began crying like the six-foot-five man-baby he is.

Not long after, he sat down on top of his hate-sign, and called the Seattle Police Department in a desperate attempt to have them play “Captain Save-a-Hoe,” begging for an escort into the park. Despite nearly an hour of melodramatic sobbing and posturing, SPD did not intervene. At one point, he laid face down, rear in the air, on top of his own sign—an oddly fitting pose for the occasion—and continued his tantrum. In a display of compassion he didn’t deserve, members of the very crowd he antagonized offered him water, assistance, and even a free trans pride flag, visible in my attached photos.

Eventually, I left him to his theatrics and returned to the festivities inside, where the mood was joyfully free of hate. Upon my exit later, SPD had finally arrived but still declined to assist him. The crowd remained firm, peacefully blocking his re-entry. He tried again to force his way through, only to walk into a tree and trip over a curb, all while screaming that he was being assaulted—claims the officers clearly didn’t believe, as no arrests were made.

I missed the final act of his performance—because frankly, I had better things to do. Like lesbian sex. 😂🤣",LilyLynne,2025-06-08 14:04:51,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l6cxsa,Seattle
